# Start of the native-nvim branch

The point of this branch is to experience the "native" Neovim experience. 
I would start without a config and slowly add whatever a i need. 

Rules:
 - NO AI code, I have to write and understand all the code. Of course.
 - NO AI assist, the manual comes first and second the internet.
  - If i have a problem with the manual i will just make a PR.
 - NO Plugins, the idea is to slowly build my own nvim. 
  - I still need to think a little more about this point.
